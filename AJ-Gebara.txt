Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        block elements take up the entire line that they are in while inline elements incorporate themselves within the line

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        position: absolute means that the element has its own layout separate from the document's layout

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        We could use display: inline, and also set its width to a certain value.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        <h1>, <p>, <ul>; <a> <span>; <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

        The box model is the container in which elements are in. It has 4 properties, content (things in the element), padding (space inside the border),
        border (wraps around the padding), and margin (space outside the border).

        We can give them all the same class name and then set the width to a certain amount of pixels. We could also set up the length of only the
        margin's left and right side with margin-left and margin-right properties.
